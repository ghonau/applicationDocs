# CosmosDB

provide network failures
--enable-automatic-failover true --locations 'southcentalus=0 eastus=1'

# Redis

Set method add key value paris to the cache
cache.StringSet("ID1", JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj));
cache.StringGet("ID1")

# Application insight

if you want not to exceed the pre-set budge
Set a daily cap for the Application Insights instance

# Function App

you can have the setting of the function in the function.json

like the following

{
"bindings":[
{
"type": "queueTrigger",
"direction": "in"
},
{
"type":"table",
"direction": "out"
}
]

}

# Queue send method

var message = new Message(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(messageBody));
await queueClient.SendAsync(message);

# Event Grid send events to Endpoint

Endpoint A will receive failure messages from any resources deployed to the Azure subscription
for this endpoint you will need to eventType filter by Microsoft.Resources.ResourceWriteFailure

Endpoint B Receives messsages whenever objects are added to a specific container in Azure Blob storage
you can filter the subject begins with /blobServices/default/containers/testcontainer to get all events for that container but not other containers in the storage account.

# CosmosDb failover

az cosmosdb update --name $name --resource-group $rg --locations "South Central US"=0 "North Central US"=1 "East US"=2

# CosmosDB consistency level

Consistent prefix: will guarantee the order of writes for all the readers

# Blob Storage lease request

# Function App authorization level

anonymous: no api key
function: a function-specific API key is required - default
admin: The master key is required.

# If you want to migrate from MongoDb to Cosmos DB

you need to use Azure Database Migration Service

# Web App Service show docker log

az webapp log config --application-logging --docker-container-logging

# Log analytics vs Application Insight

Log analytics focuses on infrastrcutre and general log data, Application Insights is more application-centric.

you can use Log Analytics for monitoring infrastrcutre health and collecting logs from various sources and Application Insights for in-depth application performance monitoring

## Log Analytics

Log analytics uses its own query lanaguage Kusto Query Language KQL and commonly used for troubleshooting, performance monitoriing and gaining insight into the health and behavior of your applications and infrustrcutre.

## Application Insights

Application Insights is particularly valuable for understanding how your application is performing in terms of the response times and user experience.
If you want to make sure that all telemetry and dependency tracking works for the third-party database

you need to use Telemetry.Id and Telemetry.Context.Operation.Id

# Logic app edit B2B workflow

You need to use Enterprice Integration Pack

you can call CloudBlockBlob.BreakLeaseAsync(new Timespan(0));
